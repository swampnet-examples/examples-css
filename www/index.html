        <div class="bob">
            <p>Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. It is a lot of fun. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.</p>

            <p class="highlight">Just use the old one inch brush. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Those great big fluffy clouds.</p>

            <p>This is your world. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.</p>
